contained in a directory. Use the unix modification time to order images
with the most recent to the top.

In order to test it you can install the dependencies using pip

 $ pip3 install -r requirements.txt

The images must be in a directory pointed by GALLERY_ROOT_DIR settings.

To test the web application you can do something like this:

 $ python app.py path/to/images

and visit http://localhost:8000.
